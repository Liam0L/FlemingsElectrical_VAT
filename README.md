# FlemingsElectrical_VAT
Flemings Electrical Ltd based in the Republic of Ireland trade with the UK. On 1st January 2021, because of Brexit, extra details are required on their VAT return to handle Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA). They have hired you to develop an application which will allow a user to type in this extra information. The information that is required is as follows: ● Year – integer value – greater than 2020 and less than 2050. ● Month – integer value – range 1 to 12. ● VAT Reference – string – minimum characters 10. ● Goods amount – float – should allow negative values. Because Flemings Electrical do not trade with the UK every month, not all months require this information to be entered.
